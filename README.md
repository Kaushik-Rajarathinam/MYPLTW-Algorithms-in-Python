## Usage:
In the book, each section goes like '1.3.0',1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc.
So each file in this repository will be labled based on it section. _(except the '.' are replaced with '-')_

All you will need to do is copy and paste the code I have and use it.
__Note: 1-3-0.py and 1-3-1.py works are not included.__

Future works will be added soon.

## Plagirism:
To avoid plagirism, try modifying my code into the format of the way you code.
ALL WORKS ARE FREE HERE. If your teacher catches you, this is not my fault, but yours, for you are the one 
who didn't listen to this one sectence.

## Narrative:
```python
print("Hello User")
# prints the function hello user
```
I am now starting to narrate my codes. You will find them in 1-3-2.py to 1-3-4.py in the ``#format``.

``#`` can also represent canceled functions.
```python
print("Hi")
#print("Your name??")
#input(">>>")  ---> CANCELED FUNCTIONS
```

___ZIP may destory format of code, so contact kr4428@pleasantonusd.net to get the actual files.___
___I will also not recommend downloading this folder, as it will be useless because it is a one-use guide.___

## Updates:
#### 1.0.2
Added new file called ``6PyPracticeProblems.py``. Contains all the python answers to the practice test problems. 
#### 1.0.1
Added Narration 1.3.2 to 1.3.4 --> New Narrations will be added for other files.
#### 1.0.0
Works from 1.3.2 to 1.3.7 have been created. New dowload files.

## Credits:
- Thanks to Daniel Dalby, my computer science teacher.
- Thanks to people who suggested to post all my code into this repository
- Made using Python 2.7 IDLE
